<h1>Hello there!👋🏼</h1>

<p>👨🏽‍💻 I am <strong>John Rohb Paloma</strong>, a first year <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student</p>

<h3>📖 About Me</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🐱‍💻 I'm a huge tech enthusiast and have been fascinated by technology since I was a kid. As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to have a career in something related to computers; I just find them incredibly cool.</li>
  <br>
  <li>♟️ One of my hobbies is playing chess. While I may not be the best player, I thoroughly enjoy spending my time playing it, especially when it's with friends.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🎵 I enjoy listening to music. Though, I don't have a particular favorite music genre sometimes I might be immersed in soft, calming jazz, and the next day, I'll be rocking out to hard metal. I just let my mood dictate my playlist.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>🎸 In my free time playing the guitar is my relaxation especially after a day of tasks. Though I've never taken it too seriously I tend to be on and off with my practice. Who knows, if I had taken it more seriously, maybe I'd be the next Tim Henson🤣🤣🤣.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🎎 I'm a huge anime fan since I was a kid, growing up watching classics like Naruto and DBZ. Even to this day, I still enjoy newer shows like JJK and KnY. Nowadays, I'm more into manga and manhwa to keep up with the stories, I'm just too impatient to wait for new anime seasons! 🤣</li>
  <br>
  <li>🤖 I have a great interest in ai. I believe that it has the potential to reach a point where it surpasses human intelligence. I can't help but be optimistic about the possibilities it could bring I see a world where something smarter than a human can tackle problems that we once perceived as impossible. Of course, challenges and ethical considerations will arise, but I believe that the positive impact of advanced AI could be profound.</li>
  
</ul>
