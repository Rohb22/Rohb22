<h1>Hello there!👋🏼</h1>

<p>👨🏽‍💻 I am <strong>John Rohb Paloma</strong>, currently a first year student undertaking <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering</strong></p>

<h3>📖 About Me</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🐱‍💻 I'm a huge tech enthusiast and have been fascinated by technology since I was a kid. As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to have a career in something related to computers; I just find them incredibly cool.</li>
  <br>
  <li>♟️ One of my hobbies is playing chess. While I may not be the best player, I thoroughly enjoy spending my time playing it, especially when it's with friends.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🎵 I enjoy listening to music. You'll often find me with earbuds in, listening to music while working on tasks or studying. I don't have a particular favorite genre because my music taste tends to change a lot depending on my mood. One day, I might be immersed in soft, calming jazz, and the next day, I'll be rocking out to hard metal🤘🏼🤘🏼.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>🎸 In my free time, I love playing the guitar. It's incredibly relaxing for me, especially after a day of tasks. I've been learning for almost five years, although I've never taken it too seriously I tend to be on and off with my practice. Who knows, though, if I had taken it more seriously, maybe I'd be the next Tim Henson🤣🤣🤣.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🎎 I'm a huge anime nerd. I've been a fan since I was a kid, growing up watching classics like Naruto and DBZ. Even to this day, I still enjoy newer shows like JJK and KnY. However, my schedule has become so busy that I've transitioned to reading manga and manhwa. It's a great way for me to enjoy the stories since I can finish them in a day, and I've become impatient with waiting for the next anime seasons, so I tend to read ahead!🤣🤣</li>
  <br>
  <li>🤖 "I have a great interest in ai. I genuinely believe that AI has the potential to reach a point where it surpasses human intelligence, although I currently view the human brain as the most powerful 'computer.' While I understand that many people may fear this change, I can't help but be optimistic about the possibilities it could bring. Call me one-sided, but I see a world where something smarter than a human can tackle problems that we once perceived as impossible. Of course, challenges and ethical considerations will arise, but I believe that the positive impact of advanced AI could be profound.</li>
  
</ul>
